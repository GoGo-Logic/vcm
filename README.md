# Legal Case Management Software for Non-Profits

Legal case management (LCM) is a software aimed for use by not-for-profit legal
advice centres in order to make better follow-ups of their work, including
client consultations and court events, as well as more efficient reporting (see
also: software overview). LCM is distributed as free software under the terms
of the GNU General Public License (GPL), either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version. See the LICENSE.md file for more information.

## Requirements

* PHP: The latest release is tested on PHP 8.0 and should work with PHP 7.0 and later.
* MySQL: The latest release is tested on MariaDB 10.3, and should work with MySQL 5.0 and later. The Postgres integration has not been tested recently.

## Installation

Download the latest tar.gz archive from our Source Forge project page
<http://sf.net/projects/legalcase> and uncompress it in a temporary
directory:

    $ cd /tmp/
    $ tar xzf /path/to/legalcase-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

After decompressing the archive, there will be a new directory called legalcase:

    $ ls -l

    drwxr-xr-x 6 user user 4096 2005-03-09 10:26 legalcase

Move the legalcase directory in a space accessible by the Apache Web server:

    $ mv legalcase /var/www/

Provide the permission to "write" to the Apache Web server for the directories
log, inc/config and inc/data:

    $ cd /var/www/legalcase/
    $ chmod a+rw log inc/config inc/data

Access to this directory from your Web browser: <http://localhost/legalcase/> 
and follow the instructions from the installation assistant.

## History

Foundation (IRBF, www.irbf.ngo-bg.org) in July 2004, as a result of research

We would also like to thank the authors of the Spip (https://www.spip.net) content
management system, from which many concepts were re-used. As well as the
Trad-Lang (https://trad.spip.net/) translation system by Florent
Jugla, which is very helpful to manage the LCM translations.
