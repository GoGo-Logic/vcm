<h3 class="spip">Collaborative work</h3>

<p class="spip">Collaborative work features refer to the different policies or habits that an organisation can adopt: they are usually a compromise between privacy of the clients and collaboration between the users (office staff).</p>
<p class="spip">Collaborative work features (or access rights) are separated into two options for users who are not explicitely assigned to a case: who has access to read the information of a case and who has access to add information.</p>
<p class="spip">For each option, the system will recommend a setting to the user, based on the typical habits of the organisation. This allows the user to select how the information of the case is shared with other users.</p>
<p class="spip">Administrators can also impose a strict policy, where users cannot decide how the case information is shared. The right to read or add information to a case can then only be modified on a case by case basis only by the administrators.</p>
<p class="spip">This is only of the criterions which influence access rights for a given case. For each case, one of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p class="spip"><li>&nbsp;Site adminstrators are given full access to all cases;
<br /><li>&nbsp;Each user assigned to a case can have its own access rights;
<br /><li>&nbsp;Other users, not assigned to the case, get access based on the collaborative work settings.</p>
<p class="spip">Note: If the above options are changed, it will not affect the settings of existing cases.</p>

<h3 class="spip">Self-registration of new users</h3>

<p class="spip">Self-registration of new users is aimed at Internet-based organisations  who allow new members to register by themselves. In other words, the case management system is open to all, but registration is required in order to access it.</p>
