  <p class="spip">When you install LCM files, some directories will not be configured correctly: therefore, you must
  modify their configuration through your usual FTP or SSH client.</p>

  <p class="spip">Since LCM writes information on the disk, you must give the web server the permission to “write” in
  the following directories:<br /></p>

  <ul class="noindent">
    <li>&nbsp;/log<br /></li>

    <li>&nbsp;/inc/data<br /></li>

    <li>&nbsp;/inc/config</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="spip">FTP “clients” differ in their functions but the procedure is generally thus:</p>


  <ul class="noindent">
    <li>&nbsp;Select the folder of which you want to modify the permissions;<br /></li>

    <li>&nbsp;Find in your FTP client a feature called “change (or modify or set permissions”;<br /></li>

    <li>&nbsp;If this feature appears as a graphical interface, check the box corresponding to “Write” for the “Others”
    (or “World” or “All users”);<br /></li>

    <li>&nbsp;If this feature appears in “text” mode, the numeric configuration is “0777”.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="spip">When you make this modification for every directory indicated by the installation system, you must
  reload the page and the procedure will resume automatically.</p>
