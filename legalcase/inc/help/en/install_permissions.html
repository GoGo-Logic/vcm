When you install LCM files, some directories will not be configured correctly: therefore, you must modify their configuration through your usual FTP or SSH client.</p>
<p class="spip">Since LCM writes information on the disk, you must give the web server  the permission to “write” in the following directories:
<br /><li>&nbsp;/log
<br /><li>&nbsp;/inc/data
<br /><li>&nbsp;/inc/config</p>
<p class="spip">FTP “clients” differ in their functions but the procedure is generally thus:</p>
<p class="spip"><li>&nbsp;Select the folder of which you want to modify the permissions;</p>
<p class="spip"><li>&nbsp;Find in your FTP client a feature called “change (or modify or set permissions”;</p>
<p class="spip"><li>&nbsp;If this feature appears as a graphical interface, check the box corresponding to “Write” for the “Others” (or “World” or “All users”);</p>
<p class="spip"><li>&nbsp;If this feature appears in “text” mode, the numeric configuration is “0777”.</p>
<p class="spip">When you make this modification for every directory indicated by the installation system, you must reload the page and the procedure will resume automatically.</p>
