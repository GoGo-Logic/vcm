  <p>When you install LCM files, some directories will not be configured correctly: therefore, you must modify their configuration through your usual FTP or SSH client.</p>

  <p>Since LCM writes information on the disk, you must give the web server the permission to ``write'' in the following directories:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>/log</li>

    <li>/inc/data</li>

    <li>/inc/config</li>
  </ul>

  <p>FTP ``clients'' differ in their functions but the procedure is generally thus:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Select the folder of which you want to modify the permissions;</li>

    <li>Find in your FTP client a feature called ``change (or modify or set permissions'';</li>

    <li>If this feature appears as a graphical interface, check the box corresponding to ``Write'' for the ``Others'' (or ``World'' or ``All users'');</li>

    <li>If this feature appears in ``text'' mode, the numeric configuration is ``0777''.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>When you make this modification for every directory indicated by the installation system, you must reload the page and the procedure will resume automatically.</p>
