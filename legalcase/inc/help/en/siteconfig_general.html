  <h3 class="spip">Site identification</h3>

  <p class="spip">The site identification is used to personalise the system according to your work environment, for
  example:</p>


  <ul class="noindent">
    <li>&nbsp;The “site name” can be the name of your organisation or the name of your project related to case
    management.<br /></li>

    <li>&nbsp;The “site description” can be a short description (3-10 words) about the aim of the site.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="spip">A typical usage is to enter the name of the organisation as the “site name” and <tt><span class=
  'spip_code' dir='ltr'>title_software</span></tt> as the “site description”.</p>

  <p class="spip">Note: The default values (<tt><span class='spip_code' dir='ltr'>title_software</span></tt> and
  <tt><span class='spip_code' dir='ltr'>title_software_description</span></tt>) are identifiers that refer to the
  translation system, and therefore show the name and description of the software according to the language of the
  visitor.</p>

  <p class="spip"><a name="contacts" id="contacts"></a></p>

  <h3 class="spip">Site location and contacts</h3>

  <p class="spip">The Internet address or network location, and the e-mail of site administrator are occasionally used
  when communicating with the user using various features.</p>

  <p class="spip">For example, users who have forgotten their password can reset it using a challenge sent by e-mail.
  This e-mail includes a hyperlink which refers to the Internet address of the system.</p>
