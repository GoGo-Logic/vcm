  <p class="spip">This step consists of entering the necessary information for the connection of LCM to the SQL
  database server.</p>


  <ul class="noindent">
    <li>&nbsp;Database address: this information should be “localhost”, but it could also be your site’s address
    (“www.mysite.org”) depending on the configuration of the server.</li>
  </ul>


  <ul class="noindent">
    <li>&nbsp;Connection login: it is often the same login you use to upload your files by FTP or SSH.</li>
  </ul>


  <ul class="noindent">
    <li>&nbsp;Connection password: it is often the same password as the one you use to access your site by FTP or
    SSH.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="spip"><strong class="spip">These settings cannot be invented: not knowing them means that your host has not
  given them to you. Therefore: if you do not have this information at hand you cannot continue.</strong></p>


  <ul class="noindent">
    <li>&nbsp;If you are not the server administrator: you must contact him/her directly. Some Internet hosts provide
    such information in an online guide or require a specific procedure for that.</li>
  </ul>


  <ul class="noindent">
    <li>&nbsp;If you are the server administrator: you can create a database for LCM with the following commands:</li>
  </ul>

  <form action="/" method="get">
    <textarea readonly='readonly' cols='40' rows='3' class='spip_cadre' dir='ltr'>
$ mysql -u root
mysql&gt; create database lcm;
mysql&gt; grant all on lcm.* to lcm_user@localhost identified by 'somepassword';
  </form>

  <p class="spip">In the above example, we create a database named “lcm” and later create a new user named “lcm_user”
  to whom we give full access to the “lcm” database.</p>

  <p class="spip">The “lcm_user” and “somepassword” will then be the connection login and connection password
  respectively for continuing the installation.</p>

  <p class="spip">Please note that the best way to connect to your database depends on your local server
  configuration.</p>
